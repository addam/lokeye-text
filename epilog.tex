We have designed and implemented a gaze tracker that can serve many real-world purposes.
The software is presented as a proof of concept and as a benchmark rig, so it is highly adjustable and modular.
Evaluation on real-world data shows that the algorithm used here work well when supplied with flawless input data, and that the results deteriorate steadily as the conditions become more challenging.
