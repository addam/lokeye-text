\section{Directory structure}
\label{s:dirstructure}

The attached data is organized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The directory {\tt bin/} contains a pre-built binary for Linux x86\_64 systems with glibc 2.4.

\item {\tt readme.html} are brief instructions for installation and usage.

\item The directory {\tt src/} contains all of the the source code of the program, in version from 2017-07.

\item The directory {\tt screencapture/} is a MSVC++ project helper tool for acquisition of ground truth data from the Tobii EyeX tracker \cite{tobii}.
It has been developed as a part of this thesis, and we believe that it may be helpful to other users of the EyeX tracker.
Note that this program can be only ran on Windows since the Tobii API is also limited to that platform.

\item The directory {\tt opencv/} contains a distribution of the OpenCV 3.1 library, which is necessary for building our program.
Instead of building this library from source, the user is recommended to download a release specific to their system from \href{http://opencv.org}.

\item The directory {\tt data/} contains the testing data sets, as described in the following attachment.

\item Finally, the file {\tt thesis.pdf} is the electronic version of this document.

\end{itemize}
